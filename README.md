## Description: A collection of projects and scripts focused on data analysis, visualization, and insights.
My name is Owaame, and I am an aspiring data scientist. 
I am creating this repository to showcase the skills I will be aquiring on Excel, Python, Power BI, SQL, Cassasre, Azure and Spark. 
I am currently attending training to become a Big Data Analyist.
Thus far, I have attained beginner skills in Excel, PowerBI, and SQL.
I am still sharpening those skills with various projects, ranging from beginner to intermediate.
